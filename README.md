# Game (doesn't have a name yet)

nothing yet

Note: 
```javascript
const b = new Tile(/* bla bla bla */)

const game = new world(/* bla bla bla */)

// and the destructoring the structure method

{ structure } = game

// and then calling it

structure() // will not work

// instead, call it from the game object itself

game.structure() // works

```
